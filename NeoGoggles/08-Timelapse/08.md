# Hardware Refresh Rate

The real speed of the LED refresh rate is `30Hz`. (traditional movies are filmed/played at 24Hz.) So the `project` call in every other run of `loop` would be real be shown. Because even though the `frameBuffer` got updated, but it would miss the chance to be sent out by it low-layer driver. But that is okay, our eyes would miss it anyway. If you insist that you could see the difference, then I would suggest that you are staring at NeoGoggles way too hard. :)
