# Knob Speed

We can change the const value 10 to a variable named interval, which is related to the reading of the Speed Knob.

```c
uint8_t interval = 1 << (knobSpeed >> 9);
```

This statement would give you interval values like `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128`, total 8 gears.

By doing this, even the color strip moves at its lowest speed, move at every 128 jiffies (a little bit over 2 seconds). You would see other knobs still work sensitively.

# Hardware Refresh Rate

The real speed of the LED refresh rate is `30Hz`. (traditional movies are filmed/played at 24Hz.) So the `project` call in every other run of `loop` would be real be shown. Because even though the `frameBuffer` got updated, but it would miss the chance to be sent out by it low-layer driver. But that is okay, our eyes would miss it anyway. If you insist that you could see the difference, then I would suggest that you are staring at NeoGoggles way too hard. :)
