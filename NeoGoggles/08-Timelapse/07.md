# Knob Speed

We can change the const value 10 to a variable named interval, which is related to the reading of the Speed Knob.

```c
uint8_t interval = 1 << (knobSpeed >> 9);
```

This statement would give you interval values like `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128`, total 8 gears.

By doing this, even the color strip moves at its lowest speed, move at every 128 jiffies (a little bit over 2 seconds). You would see other knobs still work sensitively.

# True / False

In C programming, the expressions `!(getJiffies() % interval)` and `getJiffies() % interval == 0` are functionally equivalent in the context of an `if` statement.

Let's break down each expression to understand why they are equivalent:

1. `!(getJiffies() % interval)`:
   - The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division between `getJiffies()` and `interval`.
   - The `!` operator negates the result of the remainder operation.
   - The `if` statement evaluates the expression inside the parentheses. If the expression is true (non-zero), the associated block of code is executed.

2. `getJiffies() % interval == 0`:
   - The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division between `getJiffies()` and `interval`.
   - The `==` operator checks if the result of the remainder operation is equal to zero.
   - The `if` statement evaluates the expression inside the parentheses. If the expression is true (non-zero), the associated block of code is executed.

The reason these expressions are equivalent is that the remainder of any number divided by `interval` will be zero if and only if the number is evenly divisible by `interval`. In other words, if the remainder is zero, it means that the number is a multiple of `interval`.

Therefore, both expressions check if the remainder of the division between `getJiffies()` and `interval` is zero. If it is zero, it means that `getJiffies()` is a multiple of `interval`, and the associated block of code will be executed.

It's worth noting that the `if` statement in C treats any non-zero value as true and a zero value as false. So, in this specific case, both expressions effectively check if the remainder is zero, indicating divisibility by `interval`.
