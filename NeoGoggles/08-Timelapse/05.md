# Jiffies

```c
uint32_t getJiffies(void);
void delayInJiffy(uint32_t jiffies);
```

SDK provides the concept of `Jiffy / Jiffies`, 1 jiffy is 1/60 second. `getJiffies()` would return a uint32_t(4-byte unsigned integer) that would be self-incremented by 1 every 1/60 second. It acts like a clock to the system. If `getJiffies()` return a value which is 60 larger than the last check, it would means 1 second, or 60 jiffies, has passed by.

There is a built-in `delayInJiffy(1)` after function `loop()` in the main loop. That is why `loop()` function is being called at 60Hz. And in each `loop()`, you would find the value `getJiffies()` increased by 1 than the last time.

If you did not write another `delayInJiffy()` function in `loop`, `getJiffies()` would work like a counter of how many times has `loop` being executed.

In this example, we only increase `step` when the clock is like multiple of 10. You would see the color strip rolls slower now.
