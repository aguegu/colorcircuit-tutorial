# Timing

If you flash this demo code into NeoGoggles, you would see the color strip move quite fast.

But how fast it is?

The answer is `60Hz`, which means 60 times per second.

But it is too fast, how to slow it down?

If you have some experience coding in `arduino` or other embedded system, you may suggest to put a `delay` function after a `project` call.

It would work, but with a price.

In this demo, even though the color strip move fast, the knobs are still very responsive.

If we put an `delay 1 second` in the tail of loop function, which would also delay reading new values from the knobs, like once per second. Then tuning knobs would be very frustrated I think.

A better approach is just slow down the auto-increment of `step`. If we only update `step` every 10 runs, then the color strip would only move at 1/10, which is 6Hz.
