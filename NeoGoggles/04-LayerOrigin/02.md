In `engine.h`, There is another array got exactly same length and type with `frameBuffer`. It is called `origin`.

```c
extern uint8_t origin[FRAMEBUFFER_LEN];
```

And there is a function called `project(uint8_t offset, uint8_t section)` to copy values from `origin` to `frameBuffer`.

You may have figured out how `frameBuffer` is mapped to the Led in last chapter. With `origin` array and `project` function, animation could be much easier.

*section* is how many sections(chunks) the `origin` array is split to `frameBuffer`. If it is *1*, then it is an one-on-one mapping. if it is *2*, the first half of `origin` is copy to the first half of `frameBuffer` as well as its second/last half.

*offset* is the index in `frameBuffer` where the first/head/[0] of `origin` is copied to.

By playing with the knobs, let us see how many pattens we can get from it.

Obviously, calling `project(0, 0)` is like a full clone from `origin` to `frameBuffer`.
