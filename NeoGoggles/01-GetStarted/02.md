**More about C Function Declarations**
===

In the programming world, functions are like little machines that perform specific tasks. They can take in some items (inputs), work on them, and then hand something back (output). In C programming, the way we design and label these machines is through function declarations.

Let's examine a function from our previous scaffold:
```c
void setup(void) {

}
```

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Return Type - `void` (at the beginning)**
    ```c
    void
    ```

    This word at the beginning tells us about the *type* of item this function will hand back after it has finished its task. The word `void` means "nothing." So, when you see `void` at the beginning of a function declaration, it means this function won't give back any result. It simply does its job and exits.

2. **Function Name - `setup`**
    ```c
    setup
    ```

    This is the name of our function (or machine, if you will). Just as you'd call your friend by name to get their attention, you'd call a function by its name when you want it to do its job.

3. **Parameters - `(void)` (inside the parentheses)**
    ```c
    (void)
    ```

    The parentheses `()` after the function name are a space to list any items we want to give to the function. These items are called *parameters*. Now, you might wonder, "Why do we have the word `void` inside the parentheses too?" Great observation! When `void` is inside the parentheses, it's C's way of saying, "You don’t need to give me anything; I'm good to go on my own!"

    In future lessons, you might see functions that have names or types listed inside these parentheses, indicating that the function expects some information from you. But for our `setup` function, it doesn’t need any.

---

So, putting it all together: the line `void setup(void)` tells us we have a machine named `setup`, which doesn’t need any items handed to it `(void)` and won’t hand back any result `void`.

As you continue your journey into C programming, you'll encounter functions of various shapes and sizes. But with this foundational understanding, you're well-equipped to tackle them head-on!
