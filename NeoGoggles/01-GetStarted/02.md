NeoGoggles: Dive into the vibrant world of microcontrollers and bring your colorful imaginations to life!

At the heart of NeoGoggles is the STC8H8K64U, a member of the advanced 8051 series of 8-bit MCUs. This microcontroller is a perfect blend of simplicity and capability, making it a great choice for beginners, especially when paired with the SDCC (Small Device C Compiler).

Outfitted with 32 dazzling ws2812 RGB LEDs, NeoGoggles also features 5 adjustable knobs, 2 interactive buttons, an on-board microphone, and a battery kit for untethered creativity.

While NeoGoggles comes loaded with engaging functions, the real magic happens when you program it yourself. Dream up any color, pattern, or animation, translate it into code, and see it spring to life on your NeoGoggles.

ColorCircuit is the official SDK tailored for the NeoGoggles series. This guide is your gateway to crafting custom animations and effects. Whether you've tinkered with Arduino's C programming or you're setting foot in this realm for the first time, we've got you covered. With ColorCircuit, you won't be bogged down by hardware specifics – we've streamlined that for you. And the best part? Every line of code you write will yield vivid, real-life feedback on your NeoGoggles.

Chapter 1: The framework
===

Welcome, budding programmers! Today, we're going to explore the fundamental structure of how we talk to our NeoGoggles. Picture this as the framework or skeleton of our code – the very basics we'll build upon.

```c
#include "neogoggles.h"

void setup(void) {

}

void loop(void) {

}
```

Let's break it down:

1. **Including the NeoGoggles Library**
    ```c
    #include "neogoggles.h"
    ```
    This line is like grabbing a toolkit named `neogoggles.h`. Inside this toolkit are various tools and materials, often referred to as `macros` and `function declarations`. By adding this line at the top, we're telling our code, "Hey! We want to use the tools inside the `neogoggles.h` toolkit."

2. **The `setup` Function**
    ```c
    void setup(void) {

    }
    ```
    Think of `setup` as the stage preparation before a grand play. It's a special space where we write instructions that should happen only once, right when we turn on our NeoGoggles. Maybe you want to set an initial color or configure a button when things kick off – this is where you'd do it!

3. **The `loop` Function**
    ```c
    void loop(void) {

    }
    ```
    Now, here's where the magic continuously happens! After the `setup`, our NeoGoggles enters the `loop` function. Imagine a talented drummer who keeps playing a rhythm non-stop – that's what `loop` does. It keeps running the instructions inside, over and over again, almost like a heartbeat, at a rapid pace (around 60 times every second!).

Now, with this foundation in place, we're set to start adding our creativity to NeoGoggles. Excited? Let's dive deeper and bring our ideas to life!
