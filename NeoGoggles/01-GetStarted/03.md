The 1st Demo
===

The `power` switch has to be ON when trying to flash the program in within computer. If this is the first time you flash firmware into it, it was supposed to have some led lights flowing on it. But after the scaffold flashed in. The lights is gone. NeoGoggles is totally turned off like the power switch off. Be cool, I believe NeoGoggles is working just fine and doing what you told it to do, which is NOTHING.

Yes, NOTHING. Because the left the function body empty.

The knobs do not work neither. Don't worry about it. Because there is no code to link the knobs to the LEDs. We will get to that soon.

Let's try this code below.

```c
#include "neogoggles.h"

void setup(void) {
  frameBuffer[0] = 0x10;  // 0 + 0
  frameBuffer[4] = 0x10;  // 3 + 1
  frameBuffer[8] = 0x10;  // 6 + 2
}

void loop(void) {

}
```

How is NeoGoggles looks now?

Great, it would show 3 leds lights on. One is green, one is red and one is blue. Much better than showing nothing. `frameBuffer` is an byte array defined in `neogoggles.h`

```c
#define LED_LEN 32
#define FRAMEBUFFER_LEN 96

extern uint8_t frameBuffer[FRAMEBUFFER_LEN];
```

`frameBuffer` is the data that being sent from the microcontroller to LEDs. It plays a critical role in determining what colors are shown on the NeoGoggles. But how exactly does it work? Let's dive in!

#### What is a Byte Array?

First, let's understand what an array is. Think of an array as a series of boxes lined up in a row. Each box can hold a piece of information. In the case of `frameBuffer`, it holds bytes, which are units of digital information.

`uint8_t` stands for "unsigned integer 8-bit.", aka `byte`. This means each box in the `frameBuffer` array can hold a value from 0 to 255 (inclusive).

In typical C programming lecture book, you would not see `uint8_t`, but `unsigned char`. `uint8_t` is just an alias of `unsigned char`. In embedded system development, `uint8_t` and its friends like `int_8`, `uint16_t`, `int32_t` are widely used, because it is an one-word and it tell you exactly how many bits it has.

The `[FRAMEBUFFER_LEN]` part is really important. We learn that `FRAMEBUFFER_LEN` is defined as number `96`. So `frameBuffer` is an array of `96` bytes.

**Why 96?**

Because there are 32 (as defined as `LED_LEN`) Leds on NeoGoggles. The Leds are full-colored RGB Leds. So each Led would need 3 bytes to determine its GREEN, RED and BLUE portions of color. 96 is the result of 3 times 32.

So you could program the color of each led by just putting value into `frameBuffer` as this `setup` function.



#### How `frameBuffer` Controls the LEDs

The `frameBuffer` is special because it directly controls the NeoGoggles LEDs. Each LED is represented by three boxes (or bytes) in the array:

1. The first byte controls the Red component.
2. The second byte controls the Green component.
3. The third byte controls the Blue component.

Together, these three bytes determine an LED's color. This is often referred to as an RGB value.

For example, the first LED's colors are determined by `frameBuffer[0]`, `frameBuffer[1]`, and `frameBuffer[2]`.

#### Decoding Your Code

In the code you provided:

```c
frameBuffer[0] = 0x10;  // 0 + 0
frameBuffer[4] = 0x10;  // 3 + 1
frameBuffer[8] = 0x10;  // 6 + 2
```

You've only modified three specific bytes in the `frameBuffer`. Let's break it down:

- `frameBuffer[0] = 0x10;` — This sets the Red component of the first LED. The value `0x10` is in hexadecimal format, which translates to `16` in decimal. So, you've set a mild red intensity for the first LED.

- `frameBuffer[4] = 0x10;` — This is the Red component for the second LED.

- `frameBuffer[8] = 0x10;` — This is the Red component for the third LED.

By just modifying these bytes, you've instructed the first three LEDs on the NeoGoggles to glow in a mild red color. But wait, you mentioned green and blue LEDs too! How's that possible?

Well, the way the NeoGoggles interpret missing or zero values in the `frameBuffer` is the key. If you don't specify a value (like for the Green and Blue components of the first three LEDs), the NeoGoggles might treat them as 'off' or zero. So, unless specified otherwise, the LEDs will show their default colors.

### Wrapping Up

In this lesson, you learned how the `frameBuffer` directly communicates with the NeoGoggles' LEDs. By manipulating its values, you have the power to create dazzling light displays. As you progress, you'll dive deeper into controlling individual LEDs, setting different colors, and even creating animations!

For now, try playing around with different values in the `frameBuffer` and see how it changes the look on your NeoGoggles. Happy coding!
