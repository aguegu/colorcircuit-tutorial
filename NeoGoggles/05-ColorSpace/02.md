```c
void setRGB(uint8_t n, uint8_t red, uint8_t green, uint8_t blue);
```

`setRGB` is a helper to assign color to `origin` array. One function call is as good as those three assign statements.

the `red`, `green`, `blue` agruments are all `uint8_t`, which means its range is 0~255. So each LED can have 256x256x256 = 16777216 colors.
Rremember because setRGB assigns color portions to `origin`, no matter how many times this function is called. Alway call `project` function at the end of `loop`, so `frameBuffer` would be updated.
