In `engine.h`, there are variables defined to represent the readings from the 5 knobs on NeoGoggles. Their value are refreshed before each run of `loop()` function. The range of these knobs is 0~4095 (10bit ADC).

```
extern uint16_t knobSpeed, knobSection, knobColor, knobBrightness, knobPattern;
```
